               Idon’t always find myself to be good company. Like a friend who only talks about his own hang-ups, my inner monologue can get pretty tiresome. Honestly, that again? Can’t we give it a rest?

<br/>I think most of us feel this from time to time, this desire to get away from ourselves. But all the usual remedies — entertainment or exercise, alcohol or drugs — tend to work only in small doses, if they work at all. Rely on any of them too regularly and they become habits, which is often just a gentle synonym for compulsions.

<br/>I’ve written before in this space about the brain-dulling effect of an overly routinized life. The novelist Rachel Cusk put a finer point on it when she wrote that “habits kill what is essential in ourselves.” If you’re feeling worn out by the stuff going on in your head, that’s a sure sign you need to change its inputs — give your mind something new to chew on so that it stops chewing on itself.

<br/>Here, the research on vacations can be instructive.
